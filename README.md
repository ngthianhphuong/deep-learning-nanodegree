# Deep Learning Nanodegree
This repository contains coding exercises, Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts made during Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

## Table of Contents
The Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree is composed of 5 parts:
* [Neural Networks](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/neural-networks)
* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/convolutional-neural-networks)
* [Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/recurrent-neural-networks)
* [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/generative-adversarial-networks)
* [Deployment with AWS Sagemaker](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/deployment-with-aws-sagemaker)

A README in each part gives further details about the programming exercises, mini-projects and final projects.
