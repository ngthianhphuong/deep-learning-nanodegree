# Deep Learning Nanodegree
This repository contains coding exercises, Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts made during Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

## Table of Contents
The Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree is composed of 5 parts:
#### [Neural Networks](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/neural-networks)

* Get familiar with gradient descent & backpropagation, then learn how to implement them with NumPy

* Learn how to prevent overfitting of training data and best practices for minimizing the error of a network

* Learn how to train sentiment analysis networks from Andrew Trask, author of Grokking Deep Learning

#### [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/convolutional-neural-networks)
* Spin up an instance of Amazon's GPUs to train neural networks faster

* Use Convolutional Neural Networks to identify patterns and dramatically improve performance in image-classification tasks

* Learn how to fine-tune pretrained networks and apply them to new tasks using transfer learning
#### [Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/recurrent-neural-networks)

* Explore RNNs, LSTM and similar architectures that form a memory about a sequence of inputs, over time

* Test out the role of embeddings in neural networks by implementing a word2vec model that converts words into a vector of numerical values

* Train recurrent neural networks to generate new characters, words, and bodies of text with PyTorch

#### [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/generative-adversarial-networks)
* Learn the ins & outs of Generative Adversarial Networks directly from the model’s brilliant inventor, Ian Goodfellow

* Build your own Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), a powerful model in which multi-layer neural networks compete against each other to generate realistic images of faces

* Learn how a CycleGAN formulation can learn from unlabeled sets of images from deep learning expert Jun-Yan Zhu
#### [Deployment with AWS Sagemaker](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/deployment-with-aws-sagemaker)
* Deploy your model using Amazon SageMaker and learn to apply built-in algorithms like XGBoost to a variety of tasks

* Learn to define a gateway for outside-access to your model, and see how your model responds to user input

* Learn how to monitor your model over time, how to A/B test it, and how to know when it’s time to update it

**A README in each part gives further details about the programming exercises, mini-projects and final projects.**
